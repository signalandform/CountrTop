# Creating KDS Icons

For now, you can create placeholder icons using any of these methods:

## Option 1: Online Tool
1. Go to https://realfavicongenerator.net/ or https://www.pwabuilder.com/imageGenerator
2. Upload a logo or use text "KDS"
3. Generate icons at 192x192 and 512x512
4. Download and place in this directory

## Option 2: Image Editor
1. Create a 192x192 image with background color #667eea
2. Add "KDS" text in white
3. Export as PNG: `icon-192.png`
4. Scale to 512x512: `icon-512.png`

## Option 3: Quick Placeholder (for testing)
For immediate testing, you can use any square PNG images renamed to:
- `icon-192.png` (192x192)
- `icon-512.png` (512x512)

The PWA will work even with placeholder icons.
