# KDS Icons

Place the following icon files here:
- `icon-192.png` (192x192 pixels)
- `icon-512.png` (512x512 pixels)

For now, placeholder icons can be created using any image editor or online tool.
The icons should represent the CountrTop KDS app.

To create placeholder icons quickly:
1. Use a solid color background (#667eea or similar)
2. Add "KDS" text or CountrTop logo
3. Export as PNG at the required sizes
